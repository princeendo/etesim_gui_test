Documentation of Progress on ETESim GUI

## 1. Learning Progress
### 1.1 Python Tkinter Masterclass (Udemy)
I enrolled in this class to try to learn the "correct" way to do Python GUI programming. There are multiple modules that I will be going through
#### 1.1.1 Basic Widgets
This should get me up to speed on the basics of tkinter development
##### 1.1.1.1 Creating Your First GUI Application
I successfully completed this using tkinter and ttk. Nothing really to show.
##### 1.1.1.2 Using Labels
I was able to complete this project and add a label to my GUI.
##### 1.1.1.3 Using Buttons
I successfully added a button with a label to the GUI. Clicking does nothing.
##### 1.1.1.4 Using an Entry Widget
I successfully built a GUI which has three separate fields to enter data. One was made with ttk and the others with tkinter. A password field with asterisks was part of this program, though I see little need for this in my goals. I updated the code from the tutorial to be done with classes instead of using global variables.
##### 1.1.1.5 Grid Layout
I successfully built a GUI with a grid layout while specifying columns, rows, widths, and locations. I, again, used a class methodology instead of the somewhat terrible version using globals for callback functions. I learned about spanning items across columns and how to capture input and print the values to the command line for verification
##### 1.1.1.6 Using CheckBoxes
